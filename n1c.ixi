VERSE
When lightning struck the spire of the station
We listened, lost in wonder, to the sound
a storm in from the south
a crack across the sky 
that shook us where we waited on the ground

I laughed that this was what I’d always wanted
Be washed away without a trace behind 
it breaks my heart in half
it breaks my heart in half 
No one can be this happy all the time 

CHORUS
everything will change, you said 
But what if I’m not ready 
What if I’m not ready 
What am I supposed to do instead 

VERSE 
The hours I spent fixating on the weather 
And silencing the voice inside my heart 
I could not read the signs 
I did not know you then 
And now I don’t know where to even start
 
CHORUS
everything will change, you said 
But what if I’m not ready 
What if I’m not ready 
What am I supposed to do instead 

Everything will change, you said 
But what if I’m not ready 
What if I’m not ready 
What am I supposed to do instead 

VERSE
If I could climb inside your head and stay there
If I could be the one who came prepared
A storm in from the west 
A crack across my heart
Perhaps I wouldn’t be so fucking scared
