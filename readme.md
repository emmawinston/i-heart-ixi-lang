# I ðŸ’š ixi lang

Can you live-code pop music? I'm going to try.

I've forgotten most of the Supercollider I once knew so I thought a way to get back into it might be to start using ixi lang and making my own synthdefs. I'm now a bit in love, and writing as much in it as I possibly can. 

There's a mix here of album tracks, live versions, and drafts of things that may or may not ever be finished (some of which were intended for other bands). 

Finished tracks are:

- [Bloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJSRAuPQoA8)
- [The Seaside Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAyDQdjcNq0)
- N1C
- -> (interlude) (instrumental)
- Sunset Drive
- Loop
- Perseids
- Surface
- Six very bare-bones templates for improvised instrumentals

This repository was set up when I was invited to play the [TOPLAP Moot](https://toplap.org/moot2018/) in Sheffield on the 1st of September 2018, and used this repository to build a live set, which ultimately became my mini-album [Tell Me I Can Fix This On My Own](https://github.com/emmawinston/tell-me-i-can-fix-this-on-my-own).
