# I ðŸ’š ixi lang

Can you live-code pop music? I'm going to try.

I've forgotten most of the Supercollider I once knew so I thought a way to get back into it might be to start using ixi lang and making my own synthDefs. I'm now a bit in love, and writing as much in it as I possibly can. 

Videos/audio of songs will be posted in this readme as I record them. Some things may not be linked if I'm planning a proper release later.

I'm now playing the [TOPLAP Moot](https://toplap.org/moot2018/) in Sheffield on the 1st of September. Watch this repository for my progress in building a full live set throughout July (it's fine, I work fast).
