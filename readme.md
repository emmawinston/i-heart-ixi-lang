# ixi lang experiments

I've forgotten most of the Supercollider I once knew so I thought a way to get back into it might be to start using ixi lang and making my own SynthDefs at some point. 

Videos/audio of songs will be posted in this readme as I record them.

- The Seaside Town (coming soon)
- N1C (unreleased for now)

I'm now playing the [TOPLAP Moot](https://toplap.org/moot2018/) in Sheffield on the 1st of September. Watch this repository for my progress in building a full 8-song set throughout July (it's fine, I work fast).

Can you live-code pop music? I'm going to try.
